## Flagged Answers (>15 point difference)

**No answers flagged with >15 point difference.**

After independent review, the largest score differences were ±7 points for a few answers, well within acceptable inter-rater variance for technical evaluation.

### Notable Differences (7+ points):

1. **Amrith Lotlikar - HH model code review** (Kimi2: 35, Claude: 42, +7)
   - Claude gives credit for correctly identifying forward Euler instability
   - The candidate showed good physics understanding despite missing JAX-specific issues

2. **Amrith Lotlikar - Wireless neural tx** (Kimi2: 25, Claude: 32, +7)
   - Claude recognizes the candidate correctly identified unrealistic requirements
   - Good engineering judgment shown, even if solution was conservative

3. **ADITI OAK - FDA testing morning vs afternoon** (Kimi2: 65, Claude: 58, -7)
   - Claude notes the candidate missed the key insight about participant grouping
   - Incorrectly attributed to hydration vs skin tone (Fitzpatrick scale)

## Bias Analysis

**Scores are well-aligned** (avg diff: -0.4 points)

The 0.994 correlation indicates excellent agreement between Kimi2 and Claude evaluations.

### By Category

| Category | Avg Kimi2 | Avg Claude | Bias |
|----------|-----------|------------|------|
| brain_teaser | 45.0 | 44.3 | -0.7 |
| code_review | 62.7 | 62.5 | -0.2 |
| coding | 33.6 | 32.4 | -1.2 |
| signal_processing | 31.2 | 30.5 | -0.7 |
| system_design | 34.6 | 34.0 | -0.6 |

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Strong Agreement Between AI Raters
The 0.994 correlation and ±3.2 point standard deviation indicate both AIs evaluate technical answers consistently.

### 2. Candidate Performance Tiers

**Top Performers (Avg > 60):**
- Khaled Ben Jamaa: 67.1 (Claude) / 66.3 (Kimi2)
- Natalie Wang: 63.8 (both)

**Mid-Range (40-60):**
- Amrith Lotlikar: 48.4 / 45.9
- ADITI OAK: 43.2 / 46.2
- Yi Jing: 14.2 (many unanswered questions)

**Needs Improvement (<40):**
- Manal: 32.7 / 33.6
- NAGHMEH: 25.9 (both)
- MASON HU: 23.9 / 26.0

### 3. Category Patterns

- **Code Review** scores highest (62.7 avg) - candidates better at identifying bugs than implementing solutions
- **Coding** scores lowest (33.6 avg) - many incomplete implementations
- Both AIs agree on these patterns

### 4. Scoring Tendencies

**Kimi2 slightly more lenient on:**
- Partial answers showing conceptual understanding
- Answers with approach correct but implementation flawed

**Claude slightly stricter on:**
- Missing key technical details
- Syntax errors in code
- Incomplete problem analysis

### 5. Common Evaluation Criteria (Both AIs)

Both AIs consistently penalized:
- Non-answers ("I don't know")
- Vague high-level responses without specifics
- Missing embedded system constraints (ARM Cortex-M4, memory)
- Incorrect understanding of problem requirements

Both AIs rewarded:
- Correct identification of core issues
- Proper mathematical/algorithmic approach
- Consideration of practical constraints
- Clear technical communication

---

## Recommendations

### For Assessment System:
1. **Kimi2 calibration is accurate** - Minor ±3 point variance is acceptable
2. **Consider explicit rubrics** - Would reduce variance further
3. **Flag extreme scores** - Answers <10 or >90 could use human review

### For Candidate Evaluation:
1. **Use Kimi2 scores confidently** - High correlation validates reliability
2. **Category-weighted scoring** - Consider weighting coding lower (harder questions)
3. **Tier-based recommendations** - Clear separation between top/mid/low performers

---

## Conclusion

**Kimi2's AI rating system is reliable and well-calibrated.** The average difference of -0.4 points and 0.994 correlation with my independent evaluation demonstrates consistent, trustworthy scoring. No systematic biases were detected that would unfairly advantage or disadvantage any candidate group.

The scoring accurately differentiates candidate skill levels across all question categories.
